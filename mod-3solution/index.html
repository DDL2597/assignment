    The sudden cold hit Tyrion like a hammer. As he sank he felt a stone hand fumbling at his face.
Another closed around his arm, dragging him down into darkness. Blind, his nose full of river, choking,
sinking, he kicked and twisted and fought to pry the clutching fingers off his arm, but the stone fingers
were unyielding. Air bubbled from his lips. The world was black and growing blacker. He could not
breathe.
There are worse ways to die than drowning. And if truth be told, he had perished long ago, back
in King’s Landing. It was only his revenant who remained, the small vengeful ghost who throttled Shae
and put a cross-bow bolt through the great Lord Tywin’s bowels. No man would mourn the thing that
he’d become. I’ll haunt the Seven Kingdoms, he thought, sinking deeper. They would not love me living,
so let them dread me dead.
When he opened his mouth to curse them all, black water filled his lungs, and the dark closed in
around him.
